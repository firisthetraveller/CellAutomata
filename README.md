# CellAutomata
NieR Automata, but it's not NieR, it's just cells.

## Download
Either **clone the project using Git** or **download the archive using the *green* Code button**.

## Usage
On macOS and Linux:
```sh
python3 main.py
```

On Windows (using command-lines):
```sh
py main.py
```

(untested)
It will probably run if you execute it directly from the File Explorer.

### In-App
Press on a key (on your keyboard) to update cells.
